The Space Schmup concepts I wanted to expand upon was convering the enemy with the largest amount of hitpoints, Enemy 4, into a boss. 


I would also have liked to implement a new power up that fires a slightly larger projectile at a slower firing rate that does extra damage. 

The boss Enemy 4 would spawn in after a certain score is hit. Other enemy spawns would slow down to the point where only a few enemy 0s and 3s would spawn in. The Enemy 4 would have extra hitpoints and would be much larger in size while having their spawn be reduced to just a single one. It would move at the same speed as a regular Enemy 4, requiring the player to be on their toes with positioning against it. Once it is destroyed, all normal spawns would start up. Regular enemy 4s would be removed from gameplay to balance things out a bit as well.
